# **AI Assistant – A Rule-Based Python Voice Assistant for Linux**

A **rule-based, offline, Python-powered virtual assistant** designed to simulate the workflow of an intelligent AI system. It uses **voice commands**, **speech recognition**, and **text-to-speech synthesis** to perform everyday tasks such as opening apps, reading files, playing music, and checking the system status.

## 🚀 **Features**

* 🔊 **Wake Word Activation** – “Jarvis” activates the assistant
* 🗣️ **Speech Recognition** – Converts voice to text commands
* 💬 **Text-to-Speech Output** – Provides spoken responses
* ⚙️ **System Automation** – Control brightness, volume, and apps
* 🕒 **Alarms, Timers & Reminders** – Voice-based scheduling
* 🌐 **Wikipedia & Weather Access** – Online information retrieval
* 🧠 **Offline Mode** – Core functions work without internet
* 📁 **File & Folder Management** – Create, delete, and read files
* 💾 **Persistent Data Storage** – Saves user data in JSON format
* 💬 **Conversation Mode** – Handles basic emotional dialogue

## 🧩 **System Architecture**

```
Wake Word Detection → Speech Recognition → Command Processing →
Action Execution → Response Generation → Logging & Storage
```

---

## 💻 **Tech Stack**

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Libraries:** `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `pyaudio`, `pvporcupine`, `vlc`, `pygame`, `requests`, `json`
* **Platform:** Linux (Ubuntu Recommended)

## ⚙️ **Installation**

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Sivashanmugam2304/ai-assistant.git

# Navigate into the folder
cd ai-assistant

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


#Note: Some packages like PyAudio might need additional system libraries on Linux. If someone has trouble installing, they may need to run:
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

# Run the assistant
python3 voice_assistant.py
```

## 🧠 **Project Workflow**

1. **Wake word “Jarvis”** activates the assistant.
2. Captures user voice via microphone.
3. Converts speech to text and interprets intent.
4. Executes the relevant action or system command.
5. Responds with synthesized voice output.
6. Logs all interactions in local JSON files.
